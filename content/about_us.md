## Mission 
By working with legal scholars, policy experts, technologists, and community advocates, the Tech Justice Law Project will contribute to building more equitable legal ecosystems that are fit for the digital age and which facilitate accountability and oversight of tech platforms and their products.
## Vision
To create a society in which communities can reap the benefits of technology and hold tech companies accountable for the harms facilitated by technology.

## What We Do
1. Create a Network of Tech Litigators and Tech Accountability Advocates.  TJLP is creating a community of litigators and tech reform advocates who strategically collaborate on tech accountability litigation.  
2. Nurture Creative Legal Scholarship and Practice.  TJLP is working with academics to identify and nurture fresh thinking that can inform innovative approaches to policy making and litigation. 
3. Establish Collaborative Knowledge Hubs.  TJLP is helping to build a knowledge hub of tech litigation-related resources and convenings that allows for wide documentation and dissemination of materials and ideas.
4. Build a Pipeline of Public Interest Tech Accountability Lawyers.  TJLP will expose students and junior professionals to the fight for tech accountability, exposing them to the work and create opportunities for their integration into the movement for tech reform. Initially, TJLP will work with Temple Law and Georgetown Law students in the spring of 2023.
